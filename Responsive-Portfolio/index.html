                    My name is Raymond and I really hate writing assignments.  I mean really, REALLY hate them.  Back in college I was a history major which required massive reading assignments and essay and essay after essay.  I'm kind of sick of them right now. <br><br>
                    That's why I like coding.  It doesn't matter what other people think or what their tastes consist of.  It either works or it doesn't.  I can easily check and test over and over again and seeing me work, well, WORK is a wonderful feeling as the dopamine floods my brain.
